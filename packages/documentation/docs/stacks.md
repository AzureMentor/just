Just also provides what we call "stacks" to complete the workflow of building a repository. Just Stacks provides:

1. a project generator for single package or monorepo repository via `create-just`
2. a set of `just-task`s to help keep the generated project up-to-date with the template that generated the project

## Generate a new project

It is very fast and easy to get started! We have taken care to make this experience as fast as possible. You can create a project in a couple of seconds:

```
npm init just
```

From here, you can choose a type of project to scaffold. We'll take a look the different kinds in the next sections.
